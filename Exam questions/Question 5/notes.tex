\textbf{Coupling of angular momenta in quantum mechanics:}

Coupling of angular momentum is the procesdure used to multiply to angular momentum operator. 
This is especially useful in atomic physics where we have to deal with multiple electrons, each having their own angular momentum.
Or with the case of spin-orbit coupling (nuclear physics), where we have to deal with the coupling of the orbital angular momentum and the spin angular momentum of a single electron.

\underline{Multiplying angular momenta:}

I will start with the general case of two angular momenta $\vec{J_1}$ and $\vec{J_2}$, with quantum numbers $j_1, m_1$ and $j_2, m_2$ respectively. 
$m$ being the magnetic quantum number ($m = -j, -j+1, ..., j$) and $j$ the total angular momentum quantum number ($j=0, 1/2, 1, 3/2, 2, ...$).
